# Test linked lists

These are the tests I use to unit test my implementation for LinkedLists.

It uses [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) as a testing framework.


## How to run the tests

1. Clone this repository
2. Put your implementation of linked lists in the same directory. Call it `LinkedList.h` or rename the `#include` in `test.cpp`
	- Remember to include your implementation of `Node<T>` (e.g. `Node.h`) in the same directory or inside `LinkedList.h` (not best practice) 
3. Run

```
$ g++ test.cpp -o test
$ ./test
```


That's it!
